Constructor :- 

-> It is a special method of class which automatically invoked whenever a instance of class is created.
-> Like a method it contains set of instruction which are execute at the time of object creation.
-> It is used to assign initial values to the datamember of that same class .
-> Constructor name is same name as a class name.
-> A class can have any nymmber of constructors but there should be difference like making a parameterize or something else.
-> Constructor can not be final , abstract or syncrhonized

Example :- 
 class Constructorclass
 {
     public Constructorclass()
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Welcome Back");
     }
 }

Types Of Constructor :- 
1. Default Constructor 
2. Parameterized Constructor 
3. Copy Constructor 
4. Private Constructor 
5. Static Constructor 

1. Default Constructor :- 
-> It have no parameters 
-> All time u create a object for this class inside a method which is inside that class only , value for all variables intiliaze with same values , until u are not initializing them. And to access those variables u have to create a method with in same class only.

2. Parameterized Constructor :- 
-> Its just nothing more than passing values during creating a object of a constructor 

3. Copy Constructor :- 
-> When u wanna create a object of a constructor , but using values of previous object of same constructor 
-> Its is useful when u wanna create a object based on previous object created 
-> for copyconstructor , u need to pass an previously created object in which u are passing values 

4. Private Constructor :- 
-> It can be called inside that class only where its defined
-> When u dont wanna to create a object from your class 
-> U are creating a singleton where a single object of class is exist
-> You wanna class to hold static methods , properties and etc and its should  not be initiated .

5. Static Constructor :- 
-> Its does not have any access modifier 
-> It automatically invoked before first reference to static member to a class .
-> It can't called directly
